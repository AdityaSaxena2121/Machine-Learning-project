Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the data to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.
Model Selection: Explored various machine learning algorithms for classification, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
Model Training: Trained multiple models on the dataset and optimized hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Model Deployment: Deployed the best-performing model into a production environment for real-time predictions.

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 87% with logistic regression algorithm.
